Description: Functions for repeatable processing of species occurrence datasets that makes it easier to propagate 
    georeferencing imprecisions and data input mistakes to downstream analyses, allowing analysts to assess 
    the impacts of these imprecisions. Users can use the software to: 
    (a) change each coordinate record's uncertainty from meters to decimal degrees, 
    (b) deal with records that don't have uncertainty values in multiple ways, 
    (c) create a new random location for each occurrence using a uniform distribution with a defined interval 
    within the occurrence location uncertainty, and 
    (d) use repetitions to quantify range of occurrence (EEO) or occupancy (AOO) with attribute uncertainty.
