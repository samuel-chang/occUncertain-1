Description: Repeatable processing of species occurrence datasets that makes it easier to propagate 
    georeferencing imprecisions and data input mistakes to downstream analyses, allowing analysts to assess 
    the impacts of these imprecisions in quantifying range of occurrence (EOO) or  area of occupancy (AOO) . Users can use the software to: 
    (a) change each coordinate record's uncertainty from meters to decimal degrees,
    The formula for converting from meters to decimal degrees is in part based on information from the ESRI ArcUser magazine "Measuring in Arc-Seconds" at this site{https://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0400/wdside.html}
    (b) deal with records that don't have uncertainty values in multiple ways, 
    (c) create a new random location for each occurrence using a uniform distribution with a defined interval 
    within the occurrence location uncertainty, and 
    (d) use repetitions to quantify EOO and AOO with attribute uncertainty.
